## Background

The objective of this project is to provide a Jekyll theme that is line by line perfect replica of “Startbootstrap - Agency” and at the same time to be so dynamic that can be used as a starting point for   child themes.

Currently the only difference between “Startbootstrap – Agency” and jekyll-theme-startbootstrap-agency as served with the default content is found in the final `css/agency.min.css` which is normal since the scss is compiled by different engines.
