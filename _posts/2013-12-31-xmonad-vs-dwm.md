##DRAFT Draft comparison of xmonad and dwm

<!-- more -->

**dwm pros:**
* truly minimal, tiny source
* requires no deps outside of X itself
* secure, nothing changes past compile-time
* does what I need
* doesn't require haskell
* i know what i'm doing
* conceptual and semantic simplicity
* it just works

**xmonad pros:**
* Haskell
* Easy to configure
* Easy to extend. xmonad-contrib is huge and has haddock documentation for each module.

**xmonad cons:**
* Haskell
* Dependancy size
